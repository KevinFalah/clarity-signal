📈 Clarity Signal For U

ClaritySignal is a powerful, minimalist web app for cryptocurrency traders who believe in confirmation.

✅ The Validation Checklist

This tool doesn't just give you a signal; it shows you why the signal is valid by checking it against a predefined ruleset.

For a BUY Signal (Long):

A BUY signal is only considered valid if all four of these conditions are met:

[RSI] Is the asset oversold? (RSI < 30)

[Bollinger Bands] Is the price at an extreme low? (Price < Lower Band)

[Trend] Are we in a long-term uptrend? (Price > 200-day EMA)

[Sentiment] Is the market fearful? (Fear & Greed Index < 40)

For a SELL Signal (Short/Take Profit):

A SELL signal is only considered valid if all three of these conditions are met:

[RSI] Is the asset overbought? (RSI > 70)

[Bollinger Bands] Is the price at an extreme high? (Price > Upper Band)

[Sentiment] Is the market greedy? (Fear & Greed Index > 75)
